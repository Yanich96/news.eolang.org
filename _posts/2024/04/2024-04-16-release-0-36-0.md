title: "Big changes in 0.36.0"

It's been a while since our last blog post. All this time we were working hard fixing bugs, 
creating new objects and improving EO in general. And here it is - release 
[0.36.0](https://github.com/objectionary/eo/releases/tag/0.36.0) which contains many new features.
So this blog post is summary that highlights the most significant changes.

<!--more-->
### Rho attribute
The first most significant change is related to special `ρ` (rho) attribute. A few words about it:
- in general `ρ` attribute refers to the "parent" (or context) of the object. In java, an analog 
of `ρ` would be `this` keyword
- every object has `ρ` attribute
- at the beginning, when object is formed (just created for the fist time), its `ρ` is void 
(refers to nothing)
- `ρ` is immutable and may be set only once (the rules of setting will be described in the future 
blog post)

### Vertex attribute
The second significant change is related to `ν` (vertex) attribute. We got rid of it and made our 
language simpler. 

The purpose of `ν` attribute was uniquely identify object in the universe. Before
the release [0.36.0](https://github.com/objectionary/eo/releases/tag/0.36.0) every object had such unique
numeric identifier and EO guarantied that. But we decide that giving such badges to the objects 
is not really object-oriented. We don't want and don't need to interact with object relying on it 
has some unique ID. All we want from the object - its behaviour, the functionality it provides. So 
it just does not matter if object has some identifier or not, the way it behaves with us - that's 
what really important. 

That's why objects in EO don't have `ν` attribute anymore.

### Caching
We've changed the logic of object caching in EO. 
```
some-object > cached!
```
Until now this `!` meant that if we take attributes from the object more that once, they 
will be calculated only at the first time and cached. Sounds good, but it didn't work as we wanted.

Now `!` means: when cached object is touched for the first time (for example an attribute is taken),
it's dataized, converted to `bytes` and started behave as the `bytes`. All the next manipulations 
with the cached object are transferred to the given `bytes`.

### Objects
We've done a lot of work to removing redundant objects, redesigning some old ones and introducing new
ones.

- object `while` was removed from `bool` and became a
  [separated](https://github.com/objectionary/eo/blob/0.36.0/eo-runtime/src/main/eo/org/EO/while.eo)
  object written in pure EO. Its logic is still
  [declarative](https://news.EO.org/2022-12-22-declarative-while.html) as it was before
- object `if` also was removed from `bool` and became a
  [separated](https://github.com/objectionary/eo/blob/0.36.0/eo-runtime/src/main/eo/org/EO/if.eo)
  object
- object `goto` was
  [implemented](https://github.com/objectionary/eo/blob/0.36.0/eo-runtime/src/main/eo/org/EO/go.eo)
  in pure EO
- object `dataized` was 
  [introduced](https://github.com/objectionary/eo/blob/0.36.0/eo-runtime/src/main/eo/org/EO/dataized.eo). 
  This object dataizes its argument, makes new instance of `bytes` object and behaves as it
- objects `ram` and `heap` were removed
- object `malloc` was
  [introduced](https://github.com/objectionary/eo/blob/0.36.0/eo-runtime/src/main/eo/org/EO/malloc.eo). 
  It's a classic memory management object which can allocate a block in memory, write to it, read 
  from it and free it.
- object `memory` was redesigned and
  [implemented](https://github.com/objectionary/eo/blob/0.36.0/eo-runtime/src/main/eo/org/EO/memory.eo)
  in pure EO. It uses the object `dataized` and `malloc` inside

### Grammar
We've made EO more strict by making changes in its 
[grammar rules](https://github.com/objectionary/eo#backus-naur-form):
- empty lines inside abstract object body are prohibited. Only 1 line in front of abstract object is
allowed

```
# Wrong.
[] > object

  5 > five

  10 > ten

  [] > inner

# Right.
[] > object
  5 > five
  10 > ten

  [] > inner
```
- comment in front of named abstract object is mandatory. Comment in front of anonymous (unnamed)
abstract object is prohibited. Mandatory comment must start with capital letter, end with dot, have
length >= 64 characters and include only printable characters (`0x20-0x7f`). Comments in front of other 
top-level objects are optional

```
# This is a good commentary in front of named abstract object with length >= 64 characters.
[] > object
  # This comment is optional but has the same requirements as in front of abstract object.
  while > @
    TRUE
    # This commentary is prohibited and will lead to parsing exception thrown.
    [i] (i > @)
```

- `ν` (vertex) attribute is removed from the grammar

```
# This code won't be parsed.
TRUE.< > vtx
```

- explicit object copying via `'` is removed. Until now that main purpose of explicit object copying was 
creating new object with new `ν` (vertex) attribute. But since we got rid of it - there's no more 
sense to have such operation in EO

```
# This code won't be parsed.
TRUE' > copy
```

- object caching via `!` is no more language feature but just syntax sugar for `dataized` object

```
some-object > cached!
# The same as
(dataized some-object).as-bytes > cached
```

That's it. This is what we were working on for the last 4 months. We'll try not to make such huge
breaks between blog posts in the future. So keep following us!
